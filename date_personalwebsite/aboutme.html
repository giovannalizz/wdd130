      <h3>This is my boyfriend Brandon</h3>
      <p>We met through the Mutual dating app. We had a match in June when I was still living in Brazil, and we talked for a few days, but I was already planning to apply to a BYUI university. So, we stopped talking for a while, and in November, he asked me if I was still going to the USA. I said yes, and the day I was at the Airport, I texted him saying I was arriving the next day. We had a date a few days after my arrival and have been together since December 28th, 2023. Our first date was a dinner in Kitchen 88. All the tips for the dates I have on this website were my favorite dates with him. </p>
