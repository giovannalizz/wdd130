      <p>
        I am so thrilled to have you visiting this website. If you are here, it is probably because you searched for something related to the word ‘Date.’ So you are in the right place, buddy! Like you, people often visit my website for ideas of what to do and wear. I created this website to help you with all these millions of thoughts or any thoughts you have. I am sure that after you read what I have written here, you will undoubtedly do well in the future with your following dates. Sometimes, it is so hard to invite, either in person or through text message, and how do you respond if you are the person that was texted? What is the best way to approach someone? How about physical behavior? These are the questions that I am focused on giving you the answers
      </p>
      <h4>Physical Behavior</h4>
      <p> You invite someone to go on a date with you, are you excited about that? SURE, so you have to demonstrate with your physical behavior that you are excited about that. So smile; this is your body’s first and most powerful tool. People like politeness, so kindly invite them, say things you like, and ask them what they want to do. Show that you care about their opinion, and if you don’t like what they want to do, say that you would like to try it because sometimes it is not about the place and what you will do but about the person. The right match makes everything better, so a good start is to be the right match, knowing how to behave yourself. People usually like a hug; after inviting them, hug them and say how excited you are about the date. Send a message confirming the date one day or a few hours before. </p>
      <h4>How to Approach</h4>
      <p>Compliment is the key to starting a conversation with someone. Especially if you are shy, start giving a compliment. If you see something that catches your attention, comment about it. It is not hard to create a conversation; how about keeping it until you invite them to go on a date? Always pay attention to what the other person is saying; this will make a huge difference—people like it when they feel they are paid attention. </p>
      <h4>How to invite?</h4>
      <p>So you started the conversation; now that you can see at least one thing you guys have in common, you can base your invite on what you have in common or even a simple invite, for example, “I like our conversation; could we have more conversations like that soon?</p>
      <h4>How to text?</h4>
      <p>Let’s imagine you meet someone from social media or even a dating app, and you are a little shy and don’t know how to text this person. The same way from in person can be done through text, complimenting what you observed in the person. Usually, people provide personal information about the school, signs, things they like to do, team, food, and features; you can comment on it.</p>
      <h4>How to answer?</h4>
      <p>Be kind; the other person probably is making a great effort to invite you; maybe they are overcoming their shyness to ask you to be on a date, perhaps you are their first date, or maybe they need some time to feel less stress, you never know what is going on to them, so be gentle, accept the invite, not because indeed you are going to date this person in a serious relationship, but maybe you guys can become friends if decide not to date each other or perhaps they are your right match. You are going to see with the time. Dates are essential to meet people and know exactly what you like in a person. So, if you have time, never skip a date. Have fun!</p>

      <h3>Where to go?</h3>
      <p>
        Places to go? Sometimes we have a lot of things that we could do in your city, but sometimes we live in places with almost nothing to do. Here, I give tips for dates you could spend money on and places you don’t need to spend money to have fun. So, from a simple to a fancy one, you will have a variety of places to go and have fun with your date, or even you can have other ideas from my ideas, and this is why I am here to give you a spark!
      </p>
      <h3>Roller Skating</h3>
      <p>Roller skating is always a fun activity, especially if you don’t know how to do it. It's an excellent opportunity to hold hands with someone and learn how to skate together. Even if one or both of you fall on the ground, it can be funny and make the situation even cuter. It's a great way to spend time with someone and smile a lot.</p>
      <h3>Ice Skating</h3>
      <p>Ice skating is pretty much the roller skating date, but the difference is the ice. So it is a perfect date during the winter, especially if ice skating is outdoors in your city. </p>
      <h3>Picnic</h3>
      <p>Picnic is a charming date, is suitable for spring, summer, and fall there are the best seasons to do this date. So, if you are in one of these seasons, give it a shot. Also, it is one of the options that you don’t have to spend money on. You can ask your date to bring her favorite snack, and you get yours and enjoy each other’s food.</p>
      <h3>Axe Throwing</h3>
      <p>This one is highly competitive; for those who like sports and are more energetic, it is a perfect option, very fun and very competitive. So make sure to get the vibe from the other person and surprise them with this fun date. The same goes for shooting guns. </p>
      <h3>Bowling</h3>
      <p>Bowling is a classic one. People usually love going to the bowling. Also, it is a competitive date to go. It is good to go during the winter because it is cold outside, so, during the bowling, you guys can feel more comfortable in terms of weather. Also, it is a suitable date to take more friends with you.</p>
      <h3>Movie Theater</h3>
      <p>This is an easy one to invite to go. Movies are always good in the Movie Theater. Be careful that people usually think being asked to watch a film means you want to make out, so make sure you are comfortable and clear your intentions before inviting that person. </p>
      <h3>Mini Golf</h3>
      <p>Mini golf is a more expensive date. Usually, people spend more money when the person is worth it or when it is not the first date. But it is a really good date, and even people who don’t know how to play golf have a lot of fun when they try it. </p>
      <h3>Escape Room</h3>
      <p>People usually say that before getting married to someone, it is good to take them to an escape room. It is good to see how people get under pressure. It can be fun or stressful, but you will definitely leave the escape room knowing more about the person. </p>
      <h3>Dinner</h3>
      <p>Dinner is a classic one. It can be breakfast or lunch; this is good for talking, getting to know the person better, and trying new restaurants and new kinds of food. This is always an option for the first, second, or whatever date.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>What clothes?</h3>
      <p>
       In the same way, I planned for the ‘Where to go?’ from a simple one to a fancy one; the same comes with clothes. I will not say what you have to wear; I will say what colors you should match to look good, depending on your type of skin color and what you have in your closet. Once this website is focused on girls and boys, it sounds good to say colors that can look good together depending on where you are going and if it is day or night. If you don’t have colors to match depending on what I planned, feel free to buy new clothes or match them differently; again, the idea here is to give you a spark.
      </p>
      <h3>'Pastel' Colors</h3>
      <p>These light colors are charming and romantic. Usually, people who have dark hair match this kind of color a lot. Usually, light colors are used in the morning, and they reach more with the sun’s light and the day’s clarity. So, if you plan on having a date like a picnic, those colors will be your best friends.</p>
      <h3>Panda</h3>
      <p>Black and White are always options and the classic ones. Those colors match together with all the other colors. So if you don’t know what to wear, use both or one. Also, different shades of black and white can match between them.</p>
      <h3>Royal</h3>
      <p>Those colors remind the royalty, so they are always a good match during the winter and fall; they are darker and match a lot with lighter skin. Both people with dark and blond hair fit well in those colors. </p>
      <h3>Fancy Colors</h3>
      <p>Those colors are so fancy. They are elegant and fit well for a more formal date, like dinner, golf, or movie theater. However, they can also become casual depending on the style of their clothes. So this option fits very well darker skin, incredibly dark red and brown close to yellow. The contrast of your skin color to your clothes makes you look even better. </p>
      <h3>Casual Colors </h3>
      <p>Those colors are pretty much what most people usually wear and fit well with all skin types. Clothes like dresses match better in the movie theater, dinner, picnic. So, dates that are not competitive. Wearing pants or shorts is better for sports and axe throwing. </p>
