      <p>
        I am so thrilled to have you visiting this website. If you are here, it is probably because you searched for something related to the word ‘Date.’ So you are in the right place, buddy! Like you, people often visit my website for ideas of what to do and wear. I created this website to help you with all these millions of thoughts or any thoughts you have. I am sure that after you read what I have written here, you will undoubtedly do well in the future with your following dates. Sometimes, it is so hard to invite, either in person or through text message, and how do you respond if you are the person that was texted? What is the best way to approach someone? How about physical behavior? These are the questions that I am focused on giving you the answers
      </p>
      <h4>Physical Behavior</h4>
      <p> You invite someone to go on a date with you, are you excited about that? SURE, so you have to demonstrate with your physical behavior that you are excited about that. So smile; this is your body’s first and most powerful tool. People like politeness, so kindly invite them, say things you like, and ask them what they want to do. Show that you care about their opinion, and if you don’t like what they want to do, say that you would like to try it because sometimes it is not about the place and what you will do but about the person. The right match makes everything better, so a good start is to be the right match, knowing how to behave yourself. People usually like a hug; after inviting them, hug them and say how excited you are about the date. Send a message confirming the date one day or a few hours before. </p>
      <h4>How to Approach</h4>
      <p>Compliment is the key to starting a conversation with someone. Especially if you are shy, start giving a compliment. If you see something that catches your attention, comment about it. It is not hard to create a conversation; how about keeping it until you invite them to go on a date? Always pay attention to what the other person is saying; this will make a huge difference—people like it when they feel they are paid attention. </p>
      <h4>How to invite?</h4>
      <p>So you started the conversation; now that you can see at least one thing you guys have in common, you can base your invite on what you have in common or even a simple invite, for example, “I like our conversation; could we have more conversations like that soon?</p>
      <h4>How to text?</h4>
      <p>Let’s imagine you meet someone from social media or even a dating app, and you are a little shy and don’t know how to text this person. The same way from in person can be done through text, complimenting what you observed in the person. Usually, people provide personal information about the school, signs, things they like to do, team, food, and features; you can comment on it.</p>
      <h4>How to answer?</h4>
      <p>Be kind; the other person probably is making a great effort to invite you; maybe they are overcoming their shyness to ask you to be on a date, perhaps you are their first date, or maybe they need some time to feel less stress, you never know what is going on to them, so be gentle, accept the invite, not because indeed you are going to date this person in a serious relationship, but maybe you guys can become friends if decide not to date each other or perhaps they are your right match. You are going to see with the time. Dates are essential to meet people and know exactly what you like in a person. So, if you have time, never skip a date. Have fun!</p>

      <h3>Where to go?</h3>
      <p>
        Places to go? Sometimes we have a lot of things that we could do in your city, but sometimes we live in places with almost nothing to do. Here, I give tips for dates you could spend money on and places you don’t need to spend money to have fun. So, from a simple to a fancy one, you will have a variety of places to go and have fun with your date, or even you can have other ideas from my ideas, and this is why I am here to give you a spark!

      </ul>
      <h3>What clothes?</h3>
      <p>
        In the same way, I planned for the ‘Where to go?’ from a simple one to a fancy one; the same comes with clothes. I will not say what you have to wear; I will say what colors you should match to look good, depending on your type of skin color and what you have in your closet. Once this website is focused on girls and boys, it sounds good to say colors that can look good together depending on where you are going and if it is day or night. If you don’t have colors to match depending on what I planned, feel free to buy new clothes or match them differently; again, the idea here is to give you a spark.
