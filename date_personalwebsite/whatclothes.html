        <p> In the same way, I planned for the ‘Where to go?’ from a simple one to a fancy one; the same comes with clothes. I will not say what you have to wear; I will say what colors you should match to look good, depending on your type of skin color and what you have in your closet. Once this website is focused on girls and boys, it sounds good to say colors that can look good together depending on where you are going and if it is day or night. If you don’t have colors to match depending on what I planned, feel free to buy new clothes or match them differently; again, the idea here is to give you a spark.</p>

                <h2>'Pastel' Colors</h2>
                <p>These light colors are charming and romantic. Usually, people who have dark hair match this kind of color a lot. Usually, light colors are used in the morning, and they reach more with the sun’s light and the day’s clarity. So, if you plan on having a date like a picnic, those colors will be your best friends.</p>

                <h2>Panda</h2>
                <p>Black and White are always options and the classic ones. Those colors match together with all the other colors. So if you don’t know what to wear, use both or one. Also, different shades of black and white can match between them.</p>

                <h2>Royal</h2>
                <p>Those colors remind the royalty, so they are always a good match during the winter and fall; they are darker and match a lot with lighter skin. Both people with dark and blond hair fit well in those colors.</p>

            <div class="content-grid-4">
                <h2>Fancy Colors</h2>
                <p>Those colors are so fancy. They are elegant and fit well for a more formal date, like dinner, golf, or movie theater. However, they can also become casual depending on the style of their clothes. So this option fits very well darker skin, incredibly dark red and brown close to yellow. The contrast of your skin color to your clothes makes you look even better.</p>

                <h2>Casual Colors</h2>
                <p>Those colors are pretty much what most people usually wear and fit well with all skin types. Clothes like dresses match better in the movie theater, dinner, picnic. So, dates that are not competitive. Wearing pants or shorts is better for sports and axe throwing.</p>
